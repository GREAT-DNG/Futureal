# Futureal
Futureal is a free and open source simple shooting 2D platformer built on the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) (current version is 3.5.2 LTS) using the GDScript language. The project is under development, bugs, crashes and other problems are possible. Suggestions, comments and development assistance are welcome. [TODO list](https://github.com/GREAT-DNG/Futureal/blob/master/TODO.md).
